## Expo Camera Freeze Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview freezes after taking a picture, leading to an unresponsive app. The issue is particularly noticeable when using custom camera controls.

### Problem

After capturing an image using the `takePictureAsync` method, the camera preview freezes and no further actions are possible. This renders the app unusable until it's closed and reopened.

### Solution

The solution involves using `cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync()` instead of directly calling `takePictureAsync()`.  Additionally, ensure proper error handling and state management to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Take a picture using the app.
5. Observe the freeze. 

### Additional Notes

This bug appears to be related to the way state updates interact with the camera's rendering. The solution provided is a workaround, and a more robust fix might involve deeper investigation into Expo's internal workings.
