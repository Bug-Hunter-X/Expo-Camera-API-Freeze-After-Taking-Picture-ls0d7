The solution involves ensuring proper cleanup and state management after taking a picture.  We need to make sure that resources are released properly to prevent the freeze. A modified `takePicture` function is shown below:

```javascript
const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    try {
      let photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
      setPhoto(photo.uri);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
    } finally {
      // Important: reset the camera after taking a picture
      // This might involve setting state or releasing resources
      // depending on your app's complexity. 
      // Consider adding a small delay to allow for smooth transition
      setTimeout(()=>{
          setPhoto(null)
      }, 500)
    }
  }
};
```

This improved version includes error handling and the crucial `finally` block to handle cleanup regardless of whether the picture was successfully captured.  The use of `cameraRef.current` ensures we are accessing the correct camera instance and the timeout ensures a smooth user experience by resetting the photo state after a short delay.  The exact cleanup required may depend on your particular implementation.  Consider adding more sophisticated state management to ensure a stable application.
